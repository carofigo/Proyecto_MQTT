# Proyecto_MQTT

by Andrea Carolina Figueroa Orihuela, Diego Sahid García Galván and Marco Miloslavich Airola

## A final project for the "Computational tools: the art of programming" course at ITESM

We were asked to build a program capable of connecting to a server with an open AWS IP using the "Mosquitto" message broker.

Our code is able to connect to the AWS server, ask the topic to which you want to send the message and subscribe, to later request the message and print it on the screen. Finally, a selector is displayed to the user to continue chatting or leave the chat and end the program.
